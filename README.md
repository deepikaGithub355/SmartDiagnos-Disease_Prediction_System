# SmartDiagnos-Disease_Prediction_System
"SMARTDIAGNOS" aims to harness AI Technology in health care systems.There are 
instances where online medical help (or) healthcare advise is easier and faster to grasp 
than real-world help. People often feel reluctant to go to hospital (or) physician for minor 
symptoms. However in many cases these minor symptoms may trigger major health 
hazards. As online health advice is always reachable, it can be a great head start for users.
This project aims to develop a system for disease prediction based on symptoms, 
leveraging machine learning and data analysis techniques using ‘Random Forest’ algorithm.
By training the model on historical data, it was able to learn the relationship between 
symptoms and diseases and then use this knowledge for predicting the disease. The goal is 
to provide a tool that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases accurately 
and efficiently, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes. The system will be 
designed to take a set of symptoms as input and predict the most likely diseases or conditions 
associated with those symptoms. It will analyze patterns and relationships within a 
given dataset, which comprises symptoms and corresponding diseases, to learn the 
underlying patterns and create a predictive model. The idea behind the system is to adapt to 
cope with the special requirements of the health domain related with users.
